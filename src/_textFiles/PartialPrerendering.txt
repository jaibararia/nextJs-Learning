=> Partial Prerendering

- Partial Prerendering (PPR) is a rendering strategy that allows you to combine static and dynamic content in the same route.
- This improves the initial page performance while still supporting personalized, dynamic data.

-> Enabling Partial Prerendering

- You can enable PPR by adding the ppr option to your next.config.ts file:

E.g;

import type { NextConfig } from 'next'
 
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    ppr: 'incremental',
  },
}
 
export default nextConfig

- The 'incremental' value allows you to adopt PPR for specific routes:

Where you to use ppr mention
- app/component/layout.tsx

- export const experimental_ppr = true
 
export default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  // ...
}

- Routes that don't have experimental_ppr will default to false and will not be prerendered using PPR.
- You need to explicitly opt-in to PPR for each route.

Good to know:

- "experimental_ppr" will apply to all children of the route segment, including nested layouts and pages.
- You don't have to add it to every file, only the top segment of a route.
- To disable PPR for children segments, you can set experimental_ppr to false in the child segment.
